        I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University, working under the mentorship of <a href="https://nanoneurotech.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Krishna Jayant</a> in the Nano Neurotechnology Lab. My research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms of learning and decision-making by developing novel technologies and experimental protocols. I am particularly interested in how neurons communicate and coordinate across multiple modalities to perform computations that are both robust and adaptable. To support this investigation, I developed a custom neural recording platform that integrates advanced electrode designs with a CMOS backend for multimodal interrogation of neural activity.

        I earned a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in August 2020. For my Masterâ€™s thesis, I worked with <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/mshojaei" target="_blank">Prof. Maryam Shojaei Baghini</a> to design a multi-phase oscillator for next-generation 5G receivers. During my undergraduate studies, I also collaborated with <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/mshojaei" target="_blank">Prof. Shalabh Gupta</a> on the front-end design of an IRNSS receiver (the Indian regional satellite navigation system).
